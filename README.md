# BasicChannels

An experiment in creating generative dub techno, using Swift, SwiftUI and [AudioKit](https://audiokit.io/). Uses single cycle waveforms from [Adventure Kid](https://www.adventurekid.se/akrt/waveforms/adventure-kid-waveforms/).

**Status:** Work in progress, just plays one (slightly generative but mostly hardcoded) loop with a bit of automation and a "Generate new melody" button.
